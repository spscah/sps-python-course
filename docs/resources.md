### HackerRank

Go to [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and log in using your school address. You don't have to choose Python (but if you do, use Python 3, not version 2). You can gain certification (e.g. [Python (Basic)](https://www.hackerrank.com/skills-verification/python_basic)) or just do contests. Contests are made up of individual challenges. 

Your teachers might well set you particular challenges as prep or classwork. There is a short video [here](https://www.loom.com/share/4a3c1862a6aa43c0acb5778f4b4f94b6) on how to take part in your first HackerRank challenge.
