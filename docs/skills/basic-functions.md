# Moving code to a function

When we write code into a script it gets run once. If we want to run it a second (or third) time, we have to run the script again. If we want to run the code with different values we need to change them and re-run the code. 

One way to make this easier to achieve (and to make our programs easier to read) is to use functions. 

You've already seen some functions, such as `print()` and `input()` - a function has a name, then some brackets where you can pass in some values that will be used in the function. 

A function looks like this: 

```python
def function_name(parameters, passed, into, the, function):
	a_variable = the 
	do_something = call_another_function(parameters)
	return result 
```

You have the keyword `def` at the line, then a name for the function - you can name these like variables, so they must start with a letter, contain letters, underscores or numbers - then brackets with 0 or more parameter names, then a colon. 

Then all the code in the function, which can use the variables passed in as parameters, is all indented. Then we return a value, this should be used in an assignment so that the value can be stored in a variable for subsequent use.

### Return None 

### return vs print()
