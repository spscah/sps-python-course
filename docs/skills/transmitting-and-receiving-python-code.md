# Downloading Python code 

In Google Classroom you might receive a Python file from your teacher. 

If you click on the file, you will see it in preview mode. 

You then need to click on the three dots in the top right, open in new tab. 

Then you will see a download icon to copy it on to your local machine. 

# Running Code from File Explorer 

When you double click on a Python file in explorer (or Finder on the Mac) your machine might not do what you expect. 

The default behaviour is often to run the file, rather than opening it up in your editor. 

To make sure, you should either right-click and select 'open with', or don't do it this way, but open Thonny and then open the file from there. 


# Emailing Python files

Microsoft Outlook (and other mail applications) are suspicious of Python files, so will often not let the mail receipient open the file. So you should either 

- rename to a `.txt` file, or
- create a ZIP file  

These can then be sent via email. 

(Google Classroom is not so fussy.)
