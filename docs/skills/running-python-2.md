# Other Python Apps 

## IDLE 

(If you're running a Mac or Linux, the chances are you already have this installed.)

### Windows 

Visit 

### Mac 

### Linux 

If you're running Linux, you're going to be fairly skilled, using your normal package manager install `idle3` (i.e. for Python 3, not Python 2).

```shell 
sudo apt install idle3 
```

Then run the command `idle`. (If you have Python 2 installed, this will come up, so you might actually need to run `idle3`.)

## PyCharm 
## VS.Code
# Web browser

If you are unable to run a full IDE, there are several ways of running Python in a web browser. In particular we will use a system called Colab, which is hosted on Google Drive.

There is a little more about [Colab]({% link docs/skills/colab.md %}), outlining some more details tricks and hints.
